# Project-Intro-To-Python
# For my project, I am going to do question 4.21 from Dasgupta's Algorithms.  There are 3 levels to this problem, first an proof of concept of the algorithm, applying it to some old currency exchange rate.
# The next level would be having the algorithm download new data every 15 minutes or so and updating itself.
# Finally you could have the program constantly running downloading new data and calculating the most effieicnt/ profitable route for trading currencies.
