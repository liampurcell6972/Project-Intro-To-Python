# Project-Intro-To-Python
# For my project, I am going to do question 4.21 from Dasgupta's Algorithms.  There are 3 levels to this problem, first an proof of concept of the algorithm, applying it to some old currency exchange rate.
# The next level would be having the algorithm download new data every 15 minutes or so and updating itself.
# Finally you could have the program constantly running downloading new data and calculating the most effieicnt/ profitable route for trading currencies.
# This project did not turn out exactly how I wanted, but I am happy with the result, rather than applying my algorithms to data, which was hard to find in a usuable form, my algorithms are to be applied to randomly generated exchange rates and finds both shortest paths and potential arbitrage opportunities.
# Python libraries 'netowrkX' and 'matplotlib.plotpy' were invaluable when working through this project, but it certainly could have beend one without them.
# Here is a link to the youtube video explaining most of my code, https://youtu.be/j76a7MVrhwU
