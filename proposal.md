# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
 
TODO
# "A Free Lunch: An Algorithm Using Live Currency Exchange Rates For Profit"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO
# My project will be three parts.  First a proof of concept that there exists a path between currencies that when traded upon makes money.  And further implementations, with data downloaded upon intervally, and finally constantly refreshing.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
My project, in its final portion will find the most advantageous path to turn one currency into another, and using live conversion rates, find a way to trade from your currency to your currency ending with more money than you started with (if possible).

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO
I will have an algorithm that evaluates conversion rates and finds the most advantageous path from one to another and an algorithm that will find a way to make money trading currencies and ending with the starting currency, if possible.  I want to impliment a way to download data on intervals and regularrly update, but I realize that may be difficult.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
A better outcome for me is updating data.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
Best outcome for me is I can have an algorithm that would continue running until it is stopped, constantly downloading new conversion rate data and finding the most advanageous path to trade upon.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
I honestly need to review my graph theory, because it is fairly new to me and honestly I was great at it when it was convered breifly in my senior seminar.  I also need to learn how to turn graphs I can visualize into things that computers can invision and iterate over/ work with.  Honestly with this problem, I know what I have to do, but how I am going to do it is going to be very difficult for me, I'm excited though.
